This was the first deck I evolved in Transformers TCG. It began with liking Darkmount as a character, 
and then came together when I read that Jetfire could pull Superior Plating and Superior Jetpacks from the scrap pile. 
Using Swap Parts and Quartermaster I was able to rule our early first couple of months of home TTCG play by turning Darkmount 
into a Lord-Straxus like God of a Transformer. Once he was setup, he would pierce his enemies to death while bouncing 
off their attacks with his Base-5/Tough-4 defence. Flamewar completed the team; the extra Tough-1 being much appreciated. The remaining 
star was spent on various different cards as I experimented with the star cards.

Sadly this state of affairs was not to last. As our play matured my opponents ensured there was always a bit of Upgrade-scraping in 
their deck, and then came the discovery of the death of Swap Parts. The odds of setting up 'Lord Straxus" went down and I 
started to play with the deck. In came a couple of Tech Research cards to give me a second way to put the Superior cards onto 
my characters and, then, shockingly, Darkmount was off the team. His lack of HP had become a negative as my opponents decks got 
more Aggro'd and Bold - diving deeper into Insecticons, Dinobots and Metroplex.

I experimented with 2-wide teams, but none of the allies for Jetfire could help. Ultra Magnus & Inferno were my typical gotos, 
but the lack of turns from a 2-wide didn't give Jetfire much chance. I suspect Ultra Magnus & Inferno would do a better job.

So back we were to 3-wide and the new team was Jetfire with Bombshell (1-star lower than Darkmount) and Battlemaster Aimless (2-stars higher than Flamewar). 
Not very far from the previous team. I now had a simple choice for my first defender (Aimless), and in weapon mode on the Bold-1 Jetfire 
he had a fair chance of pulling off his 3-damage ability. This team did well. It didn't rule the roost the way the way Lord Straxus had, 
but it did have a decent chance against those pesky Bold Aggros. Until we moved to the local gaming store scene and I met a Car Deck that 
was laden with Press the Advantage. The -4 heart of the team that was Bombshell was now a liability.

I went home and play-tested. I needed to make Bombshell less of a Press the Advantage magnet, and the various available 8 and 9 star 
Autobots did not seem to fill the gap. So I returned to a 24-star team by adding Insecticon Skrapnel. Now I had two decepticons who 
were both theoretically open to Press the Advantage, but in reality neither was a very desirable target. Skrapnel could (assuming a flip) 
only take 3 damage, and Aimless being killed was no skin off my back. Autobot Bold was less able to crush the team, and Skrapnel and Jetfire 
could both fill the role of body for the Plating/Jetpack/

Unfortunately the team still couldn't hold a light to the Bold Aggros when they hit an I Still Function! and got in that 2nd big Bold hit.

Here's the final deck:

Jetfire - 10 stars
Insecticon Skrapnel - 7 stars
Raider Aimless - 7 stars

I think if I started anew with the deck as a 2-wide deck, I would bring more Force Fields and flipping cards (Escape Route, Rapid Conversion). 
I would also be tempted to try a 4-wide deck. Flamewar (or I probably should buy Arcee), Red Heat with Stealth and that card switching tap ability, 
and Private Smashdown as the Autobot 5-star Battlemaster.
